function newx = bounds(newx,optimValues,problem)
%SAHONORBOUNDS ensures that the points that SIMULANNEAL  move forward with
%   are always feasible.  It does so by checking to see if the given point
%   is outside of the bounds, and then if it is, creating a point called
%   which is on the bound that was being violated and then generating a new
%   point on the line between the previous point and the projnewx. It is
%   assumed that optimValues.x is within bounds.
